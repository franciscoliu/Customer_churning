# Customer_churning
Customer attrition or “churning” (i.e., more and more customers are leaving their credit card services, such as canceling the cards) is an important problem faced by credit card companies. In this project, you are given a dataset of 10,000 customers with 18 attributes/features, such as, age, salary, marital status, credit card limit, credit card category, and so on. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict churning customers and help understand the reason behind the scene. The 5-fold cross-validation results will be used in evaluating the performance.
